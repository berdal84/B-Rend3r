# turtl3D
A turtle 3D application using OpenGL (GNU/Linux x64 only for now)

My first goal is to make a very simple 3d implementation of turtle. First I want the user to be able to write commands like :

turtle.forward(100)
turtle.rotate(rx, ry, rz)
turtle.rotateAround(vx, vy, vz, nAngle)
turtle.up()
turtle.down()

etc.
